# Commerce App
* This is my third project for the EdX "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" course.
* It consists of an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”
* It was fully developed using HTML, CSS and Python with Django.
